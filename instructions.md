This is a website where we will collate some recipies I have collected. The sitw ill be running on Github pages. Choose the most apprpriate technology for this. I won't have any kind of database to supply data, so instead we should either use json or maybe nosql - you choose the most approriate format. Here's the recipes we have so far: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b83f9218-48c8-4ffc-87b5-12783adf9bee. Assume that we will want to be able to add to this in the future, probably from an export from another claude agent. The website should have a simple, tidy landing page and inidivudal recipe pages.
